# 🐍 Vyper Expenses: Smart Contract Workshop

> Repository documenting my completed exercises and deployments of the ExpenseSplitter smart contract using Vyper.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains my fully completed exercises and solutions from the **Vyper Lang - Blockchain Hands On Workshop**. It demonstrates:

* Writing and testing smart contracts in Vyper
* Managing mappings, balances and events
* Deploying contracts to EVM compatible testnets (including Sepolia)
* Interacting with a simple Web3 frontend
* Applying security and best practices in contract development

> Templates and exercises were originally provided by the [he2plus](https://github.com/he2plus/vyper-dev).

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, I can:

* Write and test Vyper smart contracts from scratch
* Work with mappings, balances, and events
* Deploy contracts to Sepolia and other EVM compatible testnets
* Interact with contracts using a Web3 frontend
* Follow security best practices and troubleshoot common issues

## 💻 Getting Started

1. Clone **your own completed repository** to review my solutions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SukritiTkr/vyper-expenses.git
cd vyper-expenses
```

2. If you want to try the exercises yourself **from scratch**, start from the original [VyperVerse Workshop template](https://github.com/he2plus/vyper-dev).

3. Compile and deploy contracts using **Remix IDE** or **local Vyper setup**.

4. Open `frontend/index.html` to interact with the deployed contract via **MetaMask**.
