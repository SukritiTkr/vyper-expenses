# ðŸ“š Blockchain Basics

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) that are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

### Key Characteristics

- **Decentralized**: No single authority controls the network
- **Immutable**: Data cannot be altered once recorded
- **Transparent**: All transactions are visible to network participants
- **Secure**: Cryptographically secured against tampering

## How Blockchain Works

### 1. **Transaction Creation**
- Users create transactions (e.g., sending cryptocurrency)
- Transactions are signed with private keys for authentication

### 2. **Transaction Broadcasting**
- Transactions are broadcast to the network
- Nodes validate transactions using consensus mechanisms

### 3. **Block Formation**
- Valid transactions are grouped into blocks
- Miners/validators compete to create new blocks

### 4. **Consensus Mechanism**
- Network participants agree on the validity of blocks
- Common mechanisms: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS)

### 5. **Block Addition**
- Valid blocks are added to the blockchain
- The chain grows with each new block

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a runtime environment for smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It provides:

- **Deterministic Execution**: Same input always produces same output
- **Isolation**: Smart contracts run in isolated environments
- **Gas System**: Computational costs are measured in gas units

### EVM Features

- **Stack-based Architecture**: Uses a stack for computation
- **Memory Management**: Temporary storage during execution
- **Storage**: Persistent storage for smart contracts
- **Gas Metering**: Prevents infinite loops and spam

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They:

- **Automate Processes**: Execute automatically when conditions are met
- **Reduce Intermediaries**: Eliminate need for third parties
- **Increase Trust**: Code is transparent and immutable
- **Enable Programmability**: Complex logic can be implemented

### Smart Contract Lifecycle

1. **Development**: Write contract code in Solidity, Vyper, etc.
2. **Compilation**: Convert high-level code to bytecode
3. **Deployment**: Deploy to blockchain network
4. **Interaction**: Users interact with deployed contracts
5. **Execution**: EVM executes contract functions

## Gas and Transactions

### What is Gas?

Gas is the unit of measurement for computational work on the Ethereum network. It:

- **Prevents Spam**: Makes attacks economically unfeasible
- **Pays Miners**: Compensates network validators
- **Limits Computation**: Prevents infinite loops

### Gas Components

- **Gas Limit**: Maximum gas a transaction can consume
- **Gas Price**: Amount of Ether paid per gas unit
- **Gas Cost**: Gas Limit Ã— Gas Price = Total Cost

### Transaction Types

1. **Simple Transfer**: Sending Ether between accounts
2. **Contract Deployment**: Deploying new smart contracts
3. **Contract Interaction**: Calling contract functions
4. **Contract Creation**: Creating contracts from other contracts

## Accounts and Addresses

### Account Types

#### 1. **Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)**
- Controlled by private keys
- Can send transactions
- Have Ether balances
- Cannot contain code

#### 2. **Contract Accounts**
- Controlled by code
- Have Ether balances
- Can contain code (smart contracts)
- Execute when called

### Addresses

- **Format**: 40 hexadecimal characters (20 bytes)
- **Example**: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6`
- **Checksum**: Case-sensitive for error detection
- **Derivation**: Generated from public keys

## Consensus Mechanisms

### Proof of Work (PoW)
- Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles
- First to solve gets to create the next block
- Requires significant computational power
- Used by Bitcoin and Ethereum (legacy)

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Validators are chosen based on stake (amount of cryptocurrency)
- Validators create blocks and validate transactions
- More energy efficient than PoW
- Used by Ethereum 2.0 and many modern blockchains

### Other Mechanisms
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Stakeholders vote for delegates
- **Proof of Authority (PoA)**: Pre-approved validators
- **Proof of Space**: Validators prove storage space allocation

## Blockchain Networks

### Mainnet vs Testnet

#### Mainnet
- **Production Environment**: Real money and real consequences
- **High Security**: Fully secured and battle-tested
- **Real Value**: Transactions have real economic impact
- **Permanent**: Data cannot be easily reset

#### Testnet
- **Development Environment**: Free test tokens
- **Lower Security**: May have bugs or vulnerabilities
- **No Real Value**: Test tokens have no economic value
- **Resettable**: Can be reset for testing purposes

### Popular Testnets

- **Ethereum Sepolia**: Latest Ethereum testnet
- **Celo Alfajores**: Celo testnet
- **Monad Testnet**: Monad testnet
- **Berachain Testnet**: Berachain testnet

## Wallets and Key Management

### Wallet Types

#### 1. **Software Wallets**
- **Desktop**: Applications installed on computers
- **Mobile**: Apps on smartphones
- **Web**: Browser-based wallets
- **Examples**: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet

#### 2. **Hardware Wallets**
- **Physical Devices**: Dedicated hardware for key storage
- **Offline Storage**: Keys never touch the internet
- **High Security**: Resistant to malware and hacking
- **Examples**: Ledger, Trezor

#### 3. **Paper Wallets**
- **Physical Storage**: Keys printed on paper
- **Offline**: Completely offline key generation
- **Vulnerable**: Can be lost, damaged, or stolen
- **Not Recommended**: For most users

### Key Management Best Practices

- **Never Share Private Keys**: Keep them secret
- **Use Hardware Wallets**: For significant amounts
- **Backup Securely**: Store backups in safe locations
- **Use Strong Passwords**: For wallet applications
- **Enable 2FA**: When available
- **Keep Software Updated**: Regular security updates
